# SmartRAG: Graph-Enhanced Retrieval with Adaptive Policy for Knowledge-Intensive QA

---

## How to Run (Complete Guide)

### Requirements

- Linux server with NVIDIA GPU (4-8x A100 80GB recommended)
- CUDA 12.8 compatible driver
- `git`, `curl` installed
- ~200GB disk space (model weights + checkpoints)

### Step 1: Clone and Run (One Command)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunshine535/nips-smartrag.git
cd nips-smartrag
bash run.sh
```

`run.sh` will automatically:
1. Install `uv` package manager (if not present)
2. Create Python 3.10 virtual environment
3. Install PyTorch 2.10 + CUDA 12.8
4. Install all dependencies
5. Run **all experiments** in full production mode
6. Display real-time progress in terminal and save to `run.log`

### Step 2: Monitor Progress

If running in foreground (default):
```bash
# Progress is displayed in real-time
# Press Ctrl+C to stop (can resume later with bash run.sh)
```

If running in background (recommended for long experiments):
```bash
nohup bash run.sh > run.log 2>&1 &
tail -f run.log
```

### Step 3: Check Completion

```bash
cat results/.pipeline_done
# If this file exists and shows "PIPELINE_COMPLETE", all experiments finished successfully
```

### Step 4: Package and Send Results

```bash
# Option A: Push to GitHub (recommended)
git add results/ logs/
git commit -m "Experiment results $(date +%Y%m%d)"
git push origin main

# Option B: Create tarball for manual transfer
bash collect_results.sh
# Creates: results_archive/nips-smartrag_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
# Send this file via scp/email/cloud drive
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Experiment interrupted | Re-run `bash run.sh` — completed phases are automatically skipped |
| Want to re-run everything from scratch | `FORCE_RERUN=1 bash run.sh` |
| GPU out of memory | The script auto-detects GPUs; ensure CUDA drivers are installed |
| Network issues downloading models | Set `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` before running |
| Check which phases completed | `ls results/.phase_markers/` |

If running in background (recommended for long experiments):
```bash
nohup bash run.sh > run.log 2>&1 &
tail -f run.log          # Watch progress

### Step 3: Check Completion

```bash
cat results/.pipeline_done
# If this file exists and shows "PIPELINE_COMPLETE", all experiments finished successfully
```

### Step 4: Package and Send Results

```bash
# Option A: Push to GitHub (recommended)

### Output Structure

After completion, key results are in:

```
nips-smartrag/
├── results/              # All experiment outputs (JSON, figures, metrics)
│   └── .pipeline_done    # Completion marker
├── logs/                 # Per-phase log files
├── run.log               # Full pipeline log
└── results_archive/      # Packaged tarballs (after collect_results.sh)
```
